    <p>
        I first discovered programming at university, diving into Algorithms, C, Assembly, Java, and C#. Later, I taught myself HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to expand my skill set.<br />
        
        After graduation, my path began with two internships, but I quickly realized my passion for teaching. I became a full-time trainer, introducing kids to programming through <a href="https://education.lego.com/en-us" target="_blank">Lego EV3 Mindstorms</a> and <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Scratch</a>. This incredible experience even led me to give a talk about it (you can watch the recording <a href="https://youtu.be/EpV5GA-kPos?t=1303" target="_blank">here</a>).

        Eventually, I transitioned to becoming a full-time developer. Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked on diverse projects, mainly with PHP/Laravel and occasionally Angular. Working remotely during the pandemic taught me how to adapt, collaborate effectively, and keep evolving as a professional.
