        I believe in giving back to the developer community through <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/css-mastering-animations" target="_blank">knowledge-sharing</a> and mentorship. In late 2020, I founded a Moroccan developer <a href="https://drissboumlik.com/community" target="_blank">community</a> to foster a learning-focused environment.

    <p>
        Since then, Iâ€™ve hosted over 120 online <a href="https://www.facebook.com/teacode.ma" target="_blank">events</a> (a few were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@teacode-community/videos" target="_blank">recorded</a>), supported by a growing group of +1.6k members and dedicated <a target="_blank" href="https://community.drissboumlik.com/p/contributors#contributors">contributors</a>. The community has become a space for workshops, Q&A sessions, and mutual growth.
